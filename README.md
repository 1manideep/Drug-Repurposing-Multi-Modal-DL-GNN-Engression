# AI-Driven Drug Repurposing with Multi-Modal Deep Learning and Engression

This repository contains the code and supporting data for our research on **AI-driven drug repurposing**, integrating molecular, biomedical, and graph-based data into a unified deep learning pipeline.

Our framework combines **MolBERT**, **BioBERT**, and **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)** with a **heteroscedastic regression network** and an **Engression module** for modeling full conditional uncertainty.  
It achieves strong performance in predicting drug potency (pIC‚ÇÖ‚ÇÄ), calibrated confidence intervals, and ranked candidate selection.

## üß† Overview

Drug repurposing identifies new therapeutic uses for existing drugs, drastically cutting development time and cost.  
This project leverages multiple data modalities:

- **Molecular features** via [MolBERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.13230) (SMILES embeddings)  
- **Textual context** from [BioBERT](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/36/4/1234/5566506) (PubMed abstracts)  
- **Relational structure** using Graph Neural Networks over CTD (Chemical‚ÄìDisease‚ÄìGene relations)  
- **Uncertainty calibration** using **Engression**, which models the full conditional distribution of predicted drug potency

# üìä Results & Case Study

We evaluate our pipeline using regression, classification, calibration, and ranking metrics.  
The model demonstrates strong predictive accuracy and well-calibrated uncertainty estimates, supporting reliable drug candidate selection.

### Evaluation Metrics and Performance

We assess regression using **RMSE**, uncertainty calibration with **Expected Calibration Error (ECE)**, and link prediction with **AUC-ROC**, **AUPRC**, and **Precision@10**, which measures precision among the top 10 predictions.  
Models not using graph-based features (MolBERT, BioBERT) are excluded from link-level metrics.  
Statistical significance is verified through 1,000 bootstrap resamples and paired tests (*p* < 0.01).

| **Model Variant** | **RMSE ‚Üì** | **ECE (%) ‚Üì** | **AUC-ROC ‚Üë** | **AUPRC ‚Üë** | **Precision@10** |
|--------------------|------------|----------------|----------------|---------------|------------------|
| GNN only | 1.12 ¬± 0.03 | 12.8 | 0.85 ¬± 0.01 | 0.32 ¬± 0.02 | 0.60 |
| Text only (BioBERT) | 1.05 ¬± 0.02 | 10.5 | ‚Äî | ‚Äî | ‚Äî |
| MolBERT only | 0.98 ¬± 0.02 | 9.7 | ‚Äî | ‚Äî | ‚Äî |
| **Multi-modal + Engression** | **0.85 ¬± 0.02** | **4.3** | **0.93 ¬± 0.01** | **0.52 ¬± 0.03** | **1.00** |

**Table 1.** Performance comparison across model variants.

Our multi-modal model with Engression achieves the best performance:  
24 % lower RMSE than GNN-only, an ECE of 4.3 %, and perfect Precision@10 ‚Äî reliably identifying top repurposing candidates.

### Case Study ‚Äî MESH:C000598644

To evaluate real-world utility, we applied the model to disease **MESH:C000598644**.  
It identified five high-confidence drug candidates, all showing strong agreement across modalities:

- **Drug 1:** pIC‚ÇÖ‚ÇÄ = 5.28 ¬± 0.20; Confidence = 10.00; Link Score = 0.999  
- **Drug 2:** pIC‚ÇÖ‚ÇÄ = 7.99 ¬± 0.20; Confidence = 10.00; Link Score = 0.773  
- **Drug 3‚Äì5:** pIC‚ÇÖ‚ÇÄ > 7.3; Confidence = 10.00; Minimal link score  

While Drug 1 shows the strongest graph evidence, four candidates exceed the pIC‚ÇÖ‚ÇÄ = 7.0 threshold, making them prime candidates for validation.  
The figures below illustrate both potency distributions and exceedance probabilities, confirming prediction quality and calibrated confidence.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td align="center">
      <img src="media/results_1.png" width="450" alt="Predicted drug potency distributions with 1œÉ shading."><br>
      <sub><b>Fig 7.</b> Predicted drug potency distributions with 1 œÉ shading.</sub>
    </td>
    <td align="center">
      <img src="media/results_2.png" width="450" alt="Probability of exceeding pIC50 = 7.0 for each drug candidate."><br>
      <sub><b>Fig 8.</b> Probability of exceeding pIC‚ÇÖ‚ÇÄ = 7.0 for each drug candidate.</sub>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

Clear separation is observed between Drug 1 and others, with tight confidence intervals.  
Drugs 2‚Äì5 mostly exceed the therapeutic threshold.  
The multi-modal fusion prevented false positives from graph-only features (e.g., Drug 1) and correctly identified Drug 2 as the top candidate through complementary cross-modal evidence.

Residual analyses confirmed homoscedasticity and normality, indicating well-satisfied model assumptions.  
This comprehensive evaluation shows that our pipeline achieves **state-of-the-art accuracy** and **robust uncertainty calibration**, essential for reliable drug repurposing.  
The combination of predictive performance, calibrated confidence, and diagnostic stability confirms its readiness for **experimental prioritization and decision support**.
